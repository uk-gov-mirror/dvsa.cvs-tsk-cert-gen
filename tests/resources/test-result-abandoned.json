No proof was given that the vehicle used for carrying dangerous/toxic/corrosive or inflammable goods had been cleaned or otherwise rendered safe for test. The driver and/or presenter of the vehicle refused to or was unable to comply with the instructions of DVSA staff making it impractical or unsafe to continue the test. The examiner could not open the tachograph. The particulars of the motor vehicle or trailer (e.g. number of axles / axle weights) do not match the VTG6 Ministry Plate fitted to the vehicle. The relevant test fee has not been paid. The test could not be completed due to a failure of a part of the vehicle, or trailer and accompanying motor vehicle which made movement impossible. The trailer was not accompanied by a suitable motor vehicle. The vehicle did not have sufficient fuel and oil to allow the test to be carried out.",
